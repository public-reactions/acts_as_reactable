## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add acts_as_reactable

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install acts_as_reactable

## Preparations

### 1. create the Reaction model

```ruby
# rails g migration create_reactions

# with default id type
create_table :reactions do |t|
  t.references :reactable, polymorphic: true, null: false
  t.references :reactor, polymorphic: true, null: false
  t.string :emoji, null: false, index: true
  t.timestamps

  t.index [:reactable_type, :reactable_id, :reactor_type, :reactor_id, :emoji], unique: true, name: 'index_reactions_on_reactable_and_reactor_and_emoji'
end

# with uuid id
create_table :reactions, id: :uuid do |t|
  t.references :reactable, polymorphic: true, type: :uuid, null: false
  t.references :reactor, polymorphic: true, type: :uuid, null: false
  ...
end
```

### 2. annotate reactable and reactor models

```ruby
# reactable
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_reactable
end

# reactor
class User < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_reactor
end
```

## Usage

### adding/updating reactions

```ruby
post.add_reactions(user, "ðŸ˜€")
post.add_reactions(user, ["ðŸ˜ž", "ðŸ™ƒ"])
```

### removing reactions

```ruby
post.remove_reactions(user, "ðŸ˜€")
post.remove_reactions(user, ["ðŸ˜ž", "ðŸ™ƒ"])
```

### private opinion from one reactor

```ruby
reaction = ActsAsReactable::Reaction.find_by(reactable: self, reactor: user)&.emoji
```

### group, count and sort to get a summary of public opinion

```ruby
ActsAsReactable::Reaction.where(reactable: reactor).group(:emoji).order('count_id DESC').count(:id)

# { "ðŸ˜€": 10, "ðŸ˜¢": 5, "ðŸ˜£": 1 }
```

## FAQ

### Why saving "ðŸ˜‚" instead of "face_with_tears_of_joy"

- Technically, there's no concrete name/key/id for emoji (and modifiers like skin tone). The [CLDR short names](https://unicode.org/emoji/format.html#col-name) "vary by language" and "may change", besides, are those names case sensitive? Should we use `-`, `_` or ` ` as divider? How to append tone variant? There are several error prone decisions to make.
- It's easier to store since all modern database supports encodings (e.g. UTF-8) for unicode characters.
- It's easy to validate with libs/regex (e.g. [unicode-emoji](https://github.com/janlelis/unicode-emoji)).
- It takes less size on disk to store (and presumably less time to index/sort/match) one unicode character ðŸ˜‚ (4 bytes) than `face with tears of joy` (22 bytes). [This is a great article to explain how utf-8 works](https://sethmlarson.dev/blog/utf-8)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
